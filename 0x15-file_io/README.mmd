In C programming, File Input/Output (I/O) refers to the process of reading data from or writing data to files on a storage device, such as a hard drive or flash drive. It involves opening a file, performing the desired input or output operations, and then closing the file. 

File I/O is an important feature of C programming as it allows programs to access and manipulate files, which is essential for many real-world applications. In C, the standard library provides several functions to perform file I/O, including fopen(), fclose(), fread(), fwrite(), fprintf(), and fscanf(). 

The process of file I/O involves specifying the file name, mode (read, write, or append), and data type, among other parameters. C programs can read and write both text and binary files using these functions.
